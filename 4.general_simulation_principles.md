# 4. General Simulation Principles

### Steps in a simulation study

1. **Problem formulation**. Statement of problem.
    1. Profits are too low. What to do?
    2. Customers are complaining about the long lines. Help!
2. **Objectives and Planning**. What specific questions to answer.
    1. How many workers to hire?
    2. How much buffer space to insert in the assembly line?
3. **Model Building**. Both and art and a science.
    1. M/M/k queuing model?
    2. Need physics equations?
4. **Data Collection**. What kinds of data, how much?
    1. Continuous? Discrete?
    2. What exactly should be collected?
    3. Budget considerations.
5. **Coding**. Decide on language to write program.
6. **Verification**. Is the code OK? If not, go back to step 5 (Coding).
7. **Validation**. Is your model OK? If not, go back to step 3 (Modeling)
and 4 (Data Collection).
8. **Experimental Design**. What experiments need to be run to efficiently
answer our questions.
    1. Statistical considerations
    2. Time/budget
9. **Run Experiments**. Press "Go" button on your simulation. May require more time.
10. **Output Analysis**. Statistical analysis, estimate relevant measures of performance.
    1. Often iterative with 8 (Experimental Design) and 9 (Production Runs)
    2. Almost always need more runs.
11. **Make Reports, Implement, and Make Management Happy**
